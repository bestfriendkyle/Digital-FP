Digital FP was a project aimed at helping fitness professionals online with a Wordpress site.
Sites were set up using Linode cloud servers and were launched with the following plugins already activated. 
- Astra Pro
- Convert Pro
- Elementor Pro
- Lifter Elements
- Lifter LMS
- Simply Schedule

This allowed for a client to quickly design and launch their site, rather than having to select all of the funtionality of their site.

The following functions were built into the site:
- Teach online courses
- Scheduling tools
- Marketing and promotional tools
- Monthly membership auto payments

The site was launched at about 80% complete. The client was responsible for finishing the design and adding content.

The Cloud servers were configured as shown in the diagram below.
